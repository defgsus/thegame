### The Game

It's about 16 years since i worked on a 2d orthographic pixel adventure.
It was a *huge project* at the time, fully written in turbo pascal / assembler.

I'd like to reenact the fun, this time maybe in python and 
definitely with modern graphic capabilities, but keeping the
oldschool pixel style.

This repo is just a cloud backup for the moment. We'll see
where it goes..
